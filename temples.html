The temple is dedicated to worshipping Lord Murudeshwara considered to be one of the forms of Lord Shiva. The temple is situated in India in the state of Karnataka. The temple has one gripping thing is that it is surrounded by Arabian Sea from three sides and the temple premises begins with a twenty storied Gopuram. Besides that the thing that makes it way more bewitching is the location of a huge statue of Lord Shiva which is the second largest statue of Lord Shiva in India.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>The twenty storied Gopuram at the entry of the temple complex is around 237.5 feet tall and is called as Raja Gopuram. The temple has been built on a small hillock called as Kanduka. A list has been built for the convenience of the devotees which carries them to the hill top and to the top of the Gopuram.

At the foot of the temple is located a temple devoted to Shri Rameshwara. Next to the idol of Lord Shiva is the also present a shrine devoted to Shaneeshwara while below the Lord Shiva’s idol is a small cave. At the entry gate of the temple are the statues of two elephants which are believed to act as the guard to the temple. Within the temple premises is present a depiction of Lord Shiva giving the teaching of Geeta to Arjuna and beside that the depiction of Ravana giving the Atma Linga to Lord Ganesha. Except the principle sanctum, which still holds the same old flavour, the whole temple has been transformed in the contemporary style. The contemporary temple had been built by R.N Shetty, a philanthropist and businessman.
</blockquote>
 
<h4>HISTORY AND THE LEGEND ASSOCIATED</h4>
<blockquote>The temple itself has been named as per its significance, Murudeshwara refers to Shiva. The interesting story of the temple has been linked to the ear of Ramayana. As a result of the penance dedicated to the Atma Linga, Lord Shiva gave the power of invincibility and immortality to Hindu Gods. Consequently Ravana, the king of Lanka also tried wooing Lord Shiva by worshipping him so as to attain invincibility and immortality. When Lord Shiva appears before Ravana after looking at his devotion, and he asks Ravana to tell him, whatever he wants. Ravana then asks for Goddess parvathi and Lord thus gives Parvathi to Ravana.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>On the way to Lanka, Narada muni deceits him into believing that the one who was with him was not Parvathi and the real Parvathi is in Pathala. Consequently Ravana went to Pathala and married a king’s daughter who believed was real Parvathi. After knowing that he has been fooled by Naryana, he again sits to meditate As a result of which Lord Shiva Appears. This time he asked Lord Shiva to bless him with the sacred Atma Linga and Shiva accepting his demand, gave him the Lingam but puts a condition before Ravana that if ever this Lingam will be kept on the ground all its powers will come back to Lord Shiva
</blockquote>
<blockquote>This made narada to realise that with Atma Linga in his hands, Ravana will create havoc on the earth by obtaining immortality and so he thought of approaching Lord Ganesha for help. While Ravana was on the way to Lanka, Lord Vishnu planned to remove the effect of the Sun’s light so as to make it appear as dusk which will compel Ravana to perform his evening rituals and he will have to put the Linga on the ground. While he was thinking of the curse of Atma Ling, a Brahmin boy approached him who was actually Lord Ganesha. Lord Ganesha had taken up the form so that he would put the Atma Linga on the ground while he goes for the evening rituals. Lord Ganesha’s plan worked and when Ravana returned he found the Linga on the ground. This made him furious and he understood about the plan and out of anger he tried destroying the Lingam. In the process he threw the case which was covering the Lingam to Sajjeshwara at a distance of 23 miles while the lid of the case he threw to Guneshwara and Dhareshwara situated at a distance of about 10-12 km. And the piece of cloth covering the Atma Lingam he threw to Mrideshwara which was later named as Murudeshwara.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Also, at Murudeshwara, saint Bhagirath awaits for Ganga to come on the earth from the hair lock of Lord Shiva.

<h2><b>KOLLUR MOOKAMBIKE </b></h2>

</pre>
<blockquote>The Kollur Mookambika Temple/ ಕೊಲ್ಲೂರು ಮೂಕಾಂಬಿಕಾ ದೇವಸ್ಥಾನ at Kollur, Udupi District in the state of Karnataka, India, is a Hindu temple dedicated to mother parvati Devi known as Mookambika Devi. Mookambika is Shakthi devi, the supreme mother goddess in Hinduism. She is worshipped in three different forms such as Maha Kali (goddess of power) in the morning, Maha Lakshmi (goddess of wealth) in the noon and Maha Saraswati (goddess of knowledge) in the evening. There are bus train services from Byndoor Udupi and Mangalore to Kollur at regular interval.
</blockquote>
<h4>History and Mythology</h4>
<blockquote>Mythology holds that at the Kollur Mookambika Temple lived a demon named Kaumasura, who unleashed terror upon the gods by the special powers he obtained from Lord Brahma. While the gods were trying their best to stay away from him, good news came that the demon would face death. Learning of his impending doom, Kaumasura undertook severe penance. Lord Shiva appeared, asking the demon what boon he would like to be granted. Sensing that grave danger would come of the demon if his boon was granted, Saraswati, the goddess of speech took away his ability to speak. Kaumasura came to be known as Mookasura or the mute demon. Thereafter, the supreme mother parvati devi, the goddess of power, mobilized all the powers of the gods and killed the demon, and hence she came to be known as Mookambika. The place where Mookambika killed the demon came to be known as Marana Katte.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>The establishment of the Mookambika temple is attributed to the Supreme, Lord Parameshwara sadashiva, rather than to an individual person. Historically, the temple is estimated to be at least 1200 years old and is mentioned in conjunction with king Halugallu Veera Sangayya who installed an idol there.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>As a legend goes, Adi Shankara, the much revered spiritual leader from Kerala, once offered intense worship to Saraswati, the goddess of wisdom and learning. The goddess appeared before Shankara in response to his prayers. Shankara told her of his wish to have her come along with him to Kerala, where no temple was dedicated to her as yet. Goddess Saraswati agreed to go with him on the condition that Shankara must lead the way for her to follow, without doubting her and not looking back even once to check if she was with him. Should he break the condition, she would stop and stay right where she was at the time. Shankara agreed to the condition. So they started walking down the Kodachadri hills, with Shankara leading the way and goddess’ anklets tinkling and letting him know that she was with him. After walking some distance, the tinkling stopped all of a sudden. Shankara waited a few moments and stole a quick look backwards to find the goddess still with him, watching him with reproach. In keeping with the condition, the goddess stopped right there. Shankara, however, was not one to give up. He apologized profusely for breaking the condition and repeatedly begged and pleaded with the goddess to go with him to Kerala. Impressed by his determination, the goddess finally agreed to be present at the Chottanikkara Temple in Kerala in the mornings and return to the Mookambika temple by mid-day

<h4>History of Sri Kukke Subrahmanya</h4>
<blockquote>Kukke Subrahmanya is a Hindu temple located in the small, rural village of Subramanya in Sullia taluk of Dakshin Kannada District near Mangalore , India. This temple is one of the pristine pilgrimage locations in India. Here Lord Subrahmanya is worshipped as the lord of all serpents. The epics relate that the divine serpent Vasuki and other serpents found safety under Lord Subrahmanya when apprehended by Garuda.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Kukke subramanya can be reached by road from Mangalore and Bangalore.KSRTC operates buses on a daily basis from these two places. The nearest airport is the the Bajpe Airport, the Mangalore International Airport, at a distance of 115 kms. The nearest railway station is Subramanya Road railway station on Mangalore-Bangalore railway route, which is 7 km from Kukke Subramanya. There is a daily passenger train service from Mangalore. One can catch a local transport from the station for a journey of 15 minutes to the temple.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Lapped in the luxurious abundance of the beauty of the nature the village of Subramanya lies in the Sullia Taluk in south Kanara which very few places can boast of. The temple is situated in the heart of the village. Nature reveals herself in all her unhidden beauty in the rivers, forests and mountains which the temples is surrounded by. It is about a 100 KM from Mangalore and can be easily reached by buses or taxis.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>The tirtha of Subrahmanya lies in South Karnataka and is the abode of Karttikeya, the son of Lord Siva. It’s glories are described in the Sahyadri Khanda of the Skanda Purana(chapters 113-118) wherein it is described how during the Satya-yuga Karttikeya was installed as the ‘senapati’ (commander-in-chief) of the demigods on the banks of the River Dhara (or ‘Kumaradhara’ as it is commonly known). Also, after killing the demon Tarakasura, he washed the demon’s blood from his spear in the River Dhara. Admiring the beauty of this place, Karttikeya decided to reside here.
Kumaradhara River: In the Treta-yuga, Lord Parasurama came to this place and bathed in the River Dhara in order to absolve himself of the sins of exterminating the ksatriya-race twenty one times over.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>In Dvapara-yuga, when Samba, the son of Sri Krsna was cursed with leprosy, he came to bathe in the Dhara in order to become free from the disease. By smearing the mud from the riverbank over his body and bathing in the river, he regained his orignal beauty. From that time on, the waters of the Dhara River have become famous for curing skin diseases. During this age the Pandavas also visited this holy place.
In more recent times Subrahmanya was visited by Adi Sankaracarya who referred to this place as ‘Bhaje Kukke Lingam’ in his composition Subrahmanya Bhujangaprayata Stotram.
</blockquote>
<h4>The Abode of the Snake-King.</h4>
<blockquote>Previous to Karttikeya, the snake-king Vasuki took up residence in Subrahmanya. According to the Skanda Purana, Garuda was once hunting for snakes to devour and came across Vasuki hiding in a large cave (this cave is called "Biladvara" and is close to the temple). Striking Vasuki with his mighty wings and tearing at him with his sharp claws and beak, Garuda tried to kill him. Owing to Vasukis strength however, Garuda became dazed by the poisonous vapors emitting from Vasukis mouth, as well as the luminous jewels on his hood.
As they fought, the great sage Kasyapa Muni appeared and requested Garuda to desist from killing Vasuki who was a great devotee of Lord Siva.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>With great humility, Garuda folded his palms and told the sage that he was starving and had not eaten in days. Kasyapa told him, “Go to the Ramanaka Islands (modern day Fiji) where snakes and uncivilized Kiratas (hunters) are available in plenty.” Immediately Garuda went to that place to satisfy his hunger.
Turning to Vasuki, Kasyapa Muni said, “O best of serpents, go to Kumara Ksetra in the Sahyadri Mountains and pray to Lord Siva. You will never be bothered by Garuda again.” Bowing to the sage, Vasuki and his family went to Subrahmanya Ksetra and attained the blessings of Siva who told him, “In the next kalpa, my son Karttikeya will come and reside here. He will bless you and you will always remain by his side.” Later, after Karttikeya killed Tarakasura and married Indra’s daughter Devasena, Vasuki was united with him and has been worshipped alongside Karttikeya ever since.

<h4>Shree Durga Parameshwari Temple –-Overview</h4>
<blockquote>This lovely temple is located in an islet in the middle of the Nandhini River. It is a famous pilgrimage center with thousands of pilgrims visiting the temple to seek the blessings of Goddess Durga Parameshwari.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h4>Mythology</h4>
<blockquote>When the Asura Arunasura was perpetrating atrocities on the people of the Earth and terrorizing the Devas with the assurance of the boons he had got, Sage Jabali prayed to Devi Durga to rid the world of the Demon. She granted his request and appeared before Arunasura as a beautiful woman. When he came near, she told him who she was and that she had come to put an end to his tyranny. Enraged, Arunasura tried to attack her with his sword. The goddess turned to stone. Arunasura’s sword cut across the statue and a swarm of bees emerged from it and stung him to death.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Meanwhile, the planet was afflicted by a severe drought. Maharishi Jabali sought the help of the divine cow Kamadhenu to relieve the people from this drought. As she had gone to Varunaloka, he asked her daughter Nandhini to accompany him to Earth. When Nandhini repeatedly refused, the sage cursed her to become a river. This river now flows around Kateel. Kateel is formed from two base words ‘Kati’ which means center and ‘Ila’ which means area. Thus Kateel is the central region that relieved human-kind from the menace of Arunasura and the peril of a severe drought. Kati Ila later became Kateel through common usage.
