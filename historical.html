<blockquote>Hampi, also referred to as the Group of Monuments at Hampi, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site located in east-central Karnataka, India.[1] It became the centre of the Hindu Vijayanagara Empire capital in the 14th century.[2] Chronicles left by Persian and European travellers, particularly the Portuguese, state Hampi was a prosperous, wealthy and grand city near the Tungabhadra River, with numerous temples, farms and trading markets. By 1500 CE, Hampi-Vijayanagara was the world's second-largest medieval-era city after Beijing, and probably India's richest at that time, attracting traders from Persia and Portugal.[3][4] The Vijayanagara Empire was defeated by a coalition of Muslim sultanates; its capital was conquered, pillaged and destroyed by sultanate armies in 1565, after which Hampi remained in ruins.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Located in Karnataka near the modern-era city of Hosapete, Hampi's ruins are spread over 4,100 hectares (16 sq mi) and it has been described by UNESCO as an "austere, grandiose site" of more than 1,600 surviving remains of the last great Hindu kingdom in South India that includes "forts, riverside features, royal and sacred complexes, temples, shrines, pillared halls, mandapas, memorial structures, water structures and others".[7] Hampi predates the Vijayanagara Empire; there is evidence of Ashokan epigraphy, and it is mentioned in the Ramayana and the Puranas of Hinduism as Pampaa Devi Tirtha Kshetra.[2][8] Hampi continues to be an important religious centre, housing the Virupaksha Temple, an active Adi Shankara-linked monastery and various monuments belonging to the old city.
</blockquote>
<h4>Ancient to 14th century CE</h4>
<blockquote>Emperor Ashoka's Rock Edicts in Nittur and Udegolan—both in Bellary district 269-232 BCE—suggest this region was part of the Maurya Empire during the 3rd century BCE. A Brahmi inscription and a terracotta seal dating to about the 2nd century CE have been found during site excavations.[18][19] The town is mentioned in Badami Chalukya's inscriptions as Pampapura; dating from between the 6th and 8th centuries.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>By the 10th century, it had become a centre of religious and educational activities during the rule of the Hindu kings Kalyana Chalukyas, whose inscriptions state that the kings made land grants to the Virupaksha temple.[17][20] Several inscriptions from the 11th to 13th centuries are about the Hampi site, with a mention of gifts to goddess Hampa-devi.[18] Between the 12th and 14th centuries, Hindu kings of the Hoysala Empire of South India built temples to Durga, Hampadevi and Shiva, according to an inscription dated about 1,199 CE. Hampi became the second royal residence; one of the Hoysala kings was known as Hampeya-Odeya or "lord of Hampi".[17][20] According to Burton Stein, the Hoysala-period inscriptions call Hampi by alternate names such as Virupakshapattana, Vijaya Virupakshapura in honour of the old Virupaksha (Shiva) temple there.
</blockquote>
<h4>Archaeological site</h4>
<blockquote>Hampi and its nearby region remained a contested and fought-over region claimed by the local chiefs, the Hyderabad Muslim nizams, the Maratha Hindu kings, and Hyder Ali and his son Tipu Sultan of Mysore through the 18th century.[36] In 1799, Tipu Sultan was defeated and killed when the British forces and Wadiyar dynasty aligned. The region then came under British influence.[36] The ruins of Hampi were surveyed in 1800 by Scottish Colonel Colin Mackenzie, first Surveyor General of India. Mackenzie wrote that the Hampi site was abandoned and only wildlife live there. The 19th-century speculative articles by historians who followed Mackenzie blamed the 18th-century armies of Haidar Ali and the Marathas for the damage to the Hampi monuments.

   </pre>
<blockquote>Name Bidar comes from ‘bidiru’ which means bamboo.  The area of current Bidar was a bamboo jungle and in the past it called as Bedadakota or Bedarkot (kota/kot means fort).
Before being as a capital of Bahmani Sultan it has long history which takes in to 230 BC when Satvahanas became king of Deccan, from then this area of Bidar ruled by many kingdoms like Kadambas, Chalukyas, Rashtrakutas, Kalyan Chalukyas, Kalachuris and Kakatiyas. In 1270AD Yadavas of Devgiri (todays Dulatabad fort of Aurangabad) was defeated Kakatiyas and annexed to the Bedadakota (Bidar fort).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>After Yadavs were completely defeated by Ala-ud-din Khilji in 1317AD, Bedadakota came under the control of Delhi’s Sultan Muhammad Bin Tughluq. Then in 1347 Hassan Gangu a governor of Muhammad bin Tughlaq for Deccan has declared his independence and established Bahmani Sultanate at Gulbarga which is 100km from Bidar. From then Bidar came under the Bahmani Sultanate and flourished as a provincial head quarter.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Sultan Alla-Ud-Din Bahman of the Bahmani Dynasty started a massive rebuilding of old Bidar fort and he shifted his capital from Gulbarga to Bidar in 1429. Mahmud Gawan was arrived in the Bidar at 1453, he was a Persian merchant and a Muslim scholar. Gawan was served many sultans of Bidar in his 30 years of service, he appointed in the court of Alla-Ud-Din Bahaman and teacher of  Muhammad Bahamani III. When Muhammad III (1462 to 1482) became ruler, Gawan was appointed as Prime Minister, Commander-in-chief and governor of many provinces.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>During this period Bahmani sultanat recaptured the Goa from Vijaynagar and extended their boundaries from cost to cost, also many reforms was done in administration and many provinces was directly controlled under Mahmud Gawan, as a result of that revenue was increased and the projects like large hospital, Madarsa and Mosques were build. A Russian traveler Afanasy Nikitinspent four years in Bahamani Sultanat and left important notes about this period.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>But as Gawan gets successful, his enemies were increased in the court, other members considered him as an outsider and they believe the power is getting centralized under Gawan. So they laid a trap for him, they took the Gawan’s stamp on the blank page and then written a letter for offering the Orisa’s King to attack on the Bahamani Sultanate. When the king got this letter he was in drunken state and not in his sense, he ordered beheading of Mahmud Gawan on 5th April 1481. After the death of Gawan king realized his mistake and drank himself to death within one year.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>The death of Mahmud Gawan was a massive loss and Bahamani Sultanate became weaken.  Within 10 years of his death the sultanat has started broken in to pieces. In 1490 Adil Shahi of Vijapur, Nizam Shahi of Ahmadnagar, Berar Shahi/Imad Shahi of Achalpur Gavilgad has separated from Bahamani Sultanate and declared their independence.  The remaining BahamaniSultanate was went in to the hand of Qasim Barid who was became a mir-jumla and got control on Sultanate and Mahmud shah Bahamani became just a formal king with no power. After the death of Mahmud Shah Bahamani in 1518 one more part of Bahamni Sultanate has separated, Qutub Shah of Golkonda declared his independence and Amir Barid became practically king of Bidar and from then Bidar became the capital of Barid shahi.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>These five dynasties known as Deccan Sultans in Indian history and Bidar was a witness of their separation.  These fives were having conflicts between each other and as a result of that Vijaynagar became stronger till 1565. Vijaynagar was defeated and destroyed by the Deccan sultan’s collation army and after the defeat of Vijaynagar, Adil Shahi became more power full and they took over the Bidar in the 1619 and Barid Shahi was ended.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Bidar lost his identity as a capital and came under the control of Adil Shahi, but it was still a major fort which controls huge area of old Barid shahi. Knowing that Aurangzeb who was a prince and governor for Deccan of Mughal Empire has interested to expand the boundaries of Mughal Empire, which was not possible by weaken the dynasties like Adil Shahi, so he has chosen Bidar fort which was symbol of Adil shahi’s power and he has mounted a Siege around Bidar in 1657. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>In the Siege of Bidar, Mughal had army of near about 100 thousand which consists solders, matchlocks, cannons and war elephants and on the other side Adil shahi commander Sidi Marjan had army of just 5 thousand solders, but still Aurangzeb not able to capture the fort due to its double trench and strong defense. So he used the rockets, Aurangzeb may be the first person in Indian history who used rockets in war (not the Tipu Sultan). One of the rockets hit the gunpowder storage and big explosion happened, Siddi Marjan was badly wounded and after the 27 days of siege Bidar was fall and captured by Mughal. Bidar then never found his glory back and it came under the Asif Jahi (Nizam of Hyderabad) in 1724. After the independence it became the district of Karnataka state.
Today we can see some of the monuments, which witness of this capital of Deccan in medieval Indian history and one of the major is Bidar fort.

<h2><b>CHITRADURGA FORT</b></h2>
<pre>

</pre>
<blockquote>Chitradurga is the district town in Karnataka which sites at the junction of Solapur-Mangalore National Highway and Pune – Bangalore National Highway. Known for historical “Chitradurga Fort”, This region is closely associated with Mahabharata. Chitradurga fort witnessed history from the period of Chalukyas empire and famous for the legend of Onake Obawa.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>The fort was built in stages between the 11th and 13th centuries by the dynastic rulers of the region including the Chalukyas and Hoysalas, later the Nayakas of Chitradurga of the Vijayanagar Empire.[4] The Nayakas of Chitradurga, or Palegar Nayakas, were most responsible for the expansion of the fort between the 15th and 18th centuries. The fort was taken over for a short while by Hyder Ali at Chitradurga in 1779. The fort was captured by the British forces twenty years later, when they defeated his son Tipu Sultan.The fort is built in a series of seven concentric fortification walls with various passages, a citadel, masjid, warehouses for grains and oil, water reservoirs and ancient temples. There are 18 temples in the upper fort and one huge temple in the lower fort. Among these temples the oldest and most interesting is the Hidimbeshwara temple. The masjid was an addition during Hyder Ali’s rule.The fort's many interconnecting tanks were used to harvest rainwater, and the fort was said to never suffer from a water shortage.
</blockquote>
<h4>History</h4>
<blockquote>Between 1500 AD and 1800 AD, Chitradurga Fort witnessed a turbulent history starting with the Vijayanagar Empire; the empire had gained control of this region from the Hoysalas. Vijayanagar rulers brought the Nayakas, the traditional local chieftains of the area, under their control as their feudatory, until their dynastic reign ended in 1565 A.D. Thereafter, the Nayakas of Chitradurga took independent control of the region and their clan ruled for more than 200 years until the last of their rulers, Madakari Nayaka V, was defeated by Hyder Ali of Mysore Kingdom, in 1779. During all these years, Chitradurga Fort was central to the reign, particularly of the Nayakas.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Timmana Nayaka or Thimmappa Nayaka, a chieftain from Matti, during the rule of Saluva Narasimha, was the first ruler in the hierarchy of the Nayakas of Chitradurga. Initially, he was a chieftain under the Vijayanagar Empire but was soon elevated to the rank of Governor of Chitradurga by the Vijayanagar ruler in recognition of his excellent provence in military service to the empire. His rule covered areas of the Chitradurga Districtincluding Davangere,Jaglur and Harihar of present Davangere District. His rule lasted for a brief period and ended with his incarceration and death in the jail of the Vijaynagar Empire. His son Obana Nayaka or Madakari Nayaka (1588–1602) succeeded him. Madakari Nayaka was followed by a series of hierarchical or other adopted forms of successions of the same clan; Madakari Nayaka V was the final ruler of the clan from 1758 to 1779. Bharamappa Nayaka, who ruled from 1689 until 1722, is regarded as the greatest of the Nayaka rulers famed for building forts, palaces, tanks and temples, including several gateways and bastions. He fought several battles against the Mughals.

<blockquote>Chalukyan rulers were not only empire builders, but great patrons of art whose encouragement prompted the artists and craftsmen to experiment and innovate in different architectural styles and giving it a new dimension. It is in their period that transition from rock-cut medium to structural temples took place.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Pattadakal located in Bijapur district of Karnataka was not only popular for Chalukyan architectural activities but also a holy place for royal coronation, 'Pattadakisuvolal'. Temples constructed here mark the blending of the Rekha, Nagara, Prasada and the Dravida Vimana styles of temple building.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>The oldest temple at Pattadakal is Sangamesvara built by Vijayaditya Satyasraya (AD 697-733). The other notable temples at Pattadakal are the Kadasiddhesvara, Jambulingeswara both attributed to 7th century A.D. while Galaganatha temple was built a century later in the style of rekha nagara prasada. The Kasivisvesvara temple was the last to be built in early Chalukyan style. The Mallikarjuna temple was constructed by Rani Trilokyamahadevi to celebrate the victory over the Pallavas by Vikramaditya II. She is also credited to have built the Virupaksha temple influenced by the architecture of the Kailasanatha temple at Kanchipuram. The Virupaksha temple later served as a model for the Rashtrakuta ruler Krishna I (757 -783 A.D.) to carve out the great Kailasa at Ellora.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>The Virupaksha is a large complex consisting of a tall vimana with axial mandapas and peripheral sub-shrines round the court, enclosed by a wall with gopura-entrances in front and behind, all designed and completed at one time. As such, this is the earliest extant temple-complex in the Chalukyan series. The massive gopuras are also the earliest. The compound-wall of the complex, following the plan of the group itself, has on its coping kuta and said-heads, suggestive of a derivation from the Shore-temple at Mahabalipuram-a device which gives the impression of a lower storey when viewed from a distance.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>The Mallikarjuna, built immediately after and close to the Virupaksha, is a smaller temple with a four-storeyed vimana with a circular griva and sikhara. It has more or less a similar plan.

<h2><b> BAHUBALI</b></h2>
<pre>
<img src="D:\my project\images and videos\historical places\bahubali1.jpg" width="300" height="300">  <img src="D:\my project\images and videos\historical places\bahubali2.jpg" width="300" height="300">
</pre>
<blockquote>Bahubali/ಬಾಹುಬಲಿ (English: One With Strong Arms), a much revered figure among Jains, was the son of Adinath, the first tirthankara of Jainism, and the younger brother of Bharata Chakravartin. He is said to have meditated motionless for one year in a standing posture (kayotsarga) and that during this time, climbing plants grew around his legs. After his year of meditation, Bahubali is said to have attained omniscience (Kevala Gyana). According to Jain texts, Bahubali attained liberation from the cycle of births and deaths (moksha) at Mount Kailash and is revered as a liberated soul (Siddha) by the Jains.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Bahubali is also called Gommateshwara/ಗೊಮ್ಮಟೇಶ್ವರ because of the Gommateshwara statue dedicated to him. The statue was built by the Ganga dynasty minister and commander Chavundaraya; it is a 57-foot (17 m) monolith (statue carved from a single piece of rock) situated above a hill in Shravanabelagola in the Hassan district, Karnataka state, India. It was built in around 981 A.D. and is one of the largest free-standing statues in the world.
</blockquote>
<h4>The Monolithic Statue</h4>
<blockquote>The north facing stone sculpture of Lord Gommateshwara is depicted in the upright posture of meditation known as Kayotsarga that is practiced to attain salvation by practicing renunciation, self-restraint and complete dominance of ego. The digambara (nude) form is typical of Jain traditions and it symbolizes one’s victory over earthly attachments and desires that hampers their spiritual ascent towards divinity. The statue has ringlets of curly hair and large elongated ears. His eyes are open in a face with perfectly chiseled features and are sporting a faint smile tugging at the corner of his lips. His face, smile and posture embody a calm vitality ascetic detachment. The statue depicts broad shoulders with arms stretched straight down. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>The base of the statue depicts an anthill and a creeper is twined around both his legs and arms, blossoming into flowers and berries on the upper arms. The statue stands on a carved lotus flower, a symbol of his sainthood and divinity and is devoid of support from the waist up.  The statue has linguistic significance with carved inscriptions in Kannada and Tamil, as well as the oldest evidence of written Marathi, dating back to 981 AD. The inscription is dedicated in praise of the Ganga king Rachamall who funded the effort, and his general Chavundaraya, who commissioned the statue for the fulfillment of the wish of his mother.
</blockquote>
<h4>Mahamastakabhisheka Festival</h4>
<blockquote>The Gomateshwara statue atop the Shravanabelagola hill becomes the focal point of the “Mahamastakabhisheka festival” every 12 years. Mahamastabhisheka is translated as grand consecration and devotees celebrate this ritual by pouring 1008 vessels of water from scaffolding near the top of the statue. After the offering of water, the statue is anointed with a mixture of sugarcane juice, milk, and saffron. The statue is sprinkled with flower petals, turmeric and sandalwood powders along with vermillion. Devotees also offer valuable stones and coins made of silver and gold, in deference to the deity. The last Mahamastakabhisheka was held in 2006 and the next one will be held in 2018.

<h2><b>TALAKADU</b></h2>
<pre>
<img src="D:\my project\images and videos\historical places\talakadu.jpg" width="300" height="300">  <img src="D:\my project\images and videos\historical places\Talakadu (1)new.jpg" width="300" height="300">
</pre>
<blockquote>Talakadu is a desert-like town on the left bank of the Kaveri river 45 km (28 miles) from Mysore and 133 km (82 miles) from Bangalore in Karnataka, India. It once had over 30 temples, most of which now lay buried in sand. The extant group of temples, where the eastward flowing Kaveri river changes course as the sand on its banks spreads over a wide area, is a popular pilgrimagesite for Hindus.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Nestled on the banks of River Kaveri, the town of Talakadu in Karnataka is a mystic place submerged in the sand of extremely fine quality. Steeped with rich past and heritage, it is famous for its Vaidyanatheshwara Temple dedicated to Lord Shiva. The place derives its name from two local chieftains Tala and Kada and thus is called Talakadu. Situated only 3 hours drive from Bangalore, this is an ideal place for history buffs and for the devotees of Lord Shiva.  With a rich past and heritage, the town is also quite famous among the devotees who come here for a special worship.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Talakadu is situated on the left bank of River Kaveri and visitors can witness the legacy of the town that still reflects in its age-old antiquity. There are a number of temples located on the banks of River Kaveri that are buried under the sand and are excavated once in every 12 years for special worship called the 'Panchalinga Darshana'. The Panchalinga Darshana includes five major temples namely Vaidyeshwara temple, Arkeshwara temple, Vasukishwara or Pataleshwara temple Saikateshwara or Maraleshwara temple and Mallikarjuna temple. It is said that the Pataleshwara Shivalinga change colours according to the time of the day- red in the morning, black in afternoon and white in the evening.
</blockquote>
<h4>History of Talakadu</h4>
<blockquote>Talakadu finds its very first mention in relation to the Ganga line of kings. The city of Talakadu, once known to house five famous Shiva temples, was the seat of power of Gangas and the Cholas. The beginning of the 11th century saw the overthrowing of the Gangas by the CHolas after which Talakadu was renamed as Rajarajapura. It was later captured by King Vishnuvardhana who established Hoysala dominance over the land for quite a few centuries. Under the rule of Vishnuvardhana, the Talakadu comprised of seven towns and five mathas. The Hoysalas were incharge of the town until the 14th century after which the town changed many hands such as the the king of Vijayanagara and Wodeyars of Mysore.
</blockquote>
<h4>Panchalinga Darshan</h4>
<blockquote>The Panchalinga Darshana is held on a new moon day in the month of Karthika when the stars Khuha Yoga and Vishaka conjoin. Pilgrims visiting Talakuda first take a holy dip in the Gokarna theertha followed by a prayer to Gokarneswara and Chandikadevi, and then finally worship Vaidyeshwara. The ritual is concluded with a bath in the northern, eastern, southern and western stretches of the Kaveri followed by offering prayers to Arkeshwara, Pataleshwara, Maraleshwara and Mallikarjuna, returning to Vaidyeshwara after each worship and finally worshipping Kirtinarayana.
</blockquote>
<h4>Architecture of Talakadu</h4>
<blockquote>One of the most peculiar things of the temples in Talakadu is that they are covered in sand. A number of stone pillars can be found here scattered at different locations. The Vaidyeshwara temple dedicated to Lord Shiva is one of the magnificent architecture of the town built in the Dravidian style crafted out of granite. The doors of the Navaranga are carved with great details and huge Dwarapalakas decorate the entrance. Most of the temples in the city are claimed to be built under the rule of the Vijayanagar Kings with several features added by the Hoysalas. The Pathaleshwara, Maruleshwara, Arkeshwara, Vaidyanatheshwara and Mallikarjuna temples form the five revered Lingas of Talakadu and represent the five faces of Shiva. To celebrate the revered deity, a fair called the 'Panchalinga Darshan' is held every twelve years.

<h2><b>BADAMI CAVES</b></h2>
<pre>
<img src="D:\my project\images and videos\historical places\badami.jpg" width="300" height="300">  <img src="D:\my project\images and videos\historical places\badami2.jpg" width="300" height="300">  <img src="D:\my project\images and videos\historical places\badami3.jpg" width="300" height="300">
</pre>
<blockquote>The Badami cave temples are a complex of four Hindu, a Jain and possibly Buddhist cave temples located in Badami, a town in the Bagalkot district in northern part of Karnataka, India. The caves are considered an example of Indian rock-cut architecture, especially Badami Chalukya architecture, which dates from the 6th century. Badami was previously known as Vataapi Badami, the capital of the early Chalukya dynasty, which ruled much of Karnataka from the 6th to the 8th century. Badami is situated on the west bank of a man made lake ringed by an earthen wall with stone steps; it is surrounded on the north and south by forts built in later times.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>The Badami cave temples represent some of the earliest known examples of Hindu temples in the Deccan region. They along with the temples in Aihole transformed the Malaprabha River valley into a cradle of temple architecture that influenced the components of later Hindu temples elsewhere in India.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Caves 1 to 4 are in the escarpment of the hill in soft Badami sandstone formation, to the south-east of the town. In Cave 1, among various sculptures of Hindu divinities and themes, a prominent carving is of the Tandava-dancing Shiva as Nataraja. Cave 2 is mostly similar to Cave 1 in terms of its layout and dimensions, featuring Hindu subjects of which the relief of Vishnu as Trivikrama is the largest. The largest cave is Cave 3, featuring Vishnu-related mythology, and it is also the most intricately carved cave in the complex. Cave 4 is dedicated to revered figures of Jainism. Around the lake, Badami has additional caves of which one may be a Buddhist cave. Another cave was discovered in 2015, about 500 metres (1,600 ft) from the four main caves, with 27 Hindu carvings.
</blockquote>
<h4>History</h4>
<blockquote>The cave temples, numbered 1 to 4 in the order of their creation, in the town of Badami – the capital city of the Chalukya kingdom (also known as Early Chalukyas]) – are dated from the late 6th century onwards. The exact dating is known only for Cave 3, which is a temple dedicated to Vishnu. An inscription found here records the dedication of the shrine by Mangalesha in Saka 500 (lunar calendar, 578/579 CE)  The inscription, written in the old Kannada language,  has enabled the dating of these rock cave temples to the 6th century.  This makes the cave the oldest firmly-dated Hindu cave temple in India. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>The Badami caves complex is part of a UNESCO-designated World Heritage Site candidate under the title "Evolution of Temple Architecture – Aihole-Badami-Pattadakal" in the Malaprabha river valley, considered a cradle of temple architecture that formed the model for later Hindu temples in the region . The artwork in Caves 1 and 2 exhibit the northern Deccan style of the 6th and 7th centuries, while those in Cave 3 simultaneously represent two ancient Indian artistic traditions; the northern Nagara and the southern Dravida styles. Cave 3 also shows icons and reliefs in the so-called Vesara style, a fusion of ideas from the two styles, as well as some of the earliest surviving historical examples in Karnataka of yantra-chakra motifs (geometric symbolism) and colored fresco paintings.  The first three caves feature sculptures of Hindu icons and legends focusing on Shiva and Vishnu,  while Cave 4 features Jain icons and themes.
</blockquote>
<h4>Temple caves</h4>
<blockquote>The Badami cave temples are carved out of soft Badami sandstone on a hill cliff.  The plan of each of the four caves (1 to 4) includes an entrance with a verandah (mukha mandapa) supported by stone columns and brackets, a distinctive feature of these caves, leading to a columned mandapa, or main hall (also maha mandapa), and then to the small, square shrine (sanctum sanctorum, garbha ghriya) cut deep inside the cave.  The cave temples are linked by a stepped path with intermediate terraces overlooking the town and lake. The cave temples are labelled 1–4 in their ascending series; this numbering does not reflect the sequence of excavation.
The architecture includes structures built in the Nagara and Dravidian styles, which is the first and most persistent architectural idiom to be adopted by the early chalukyas.

<h2><b> AIHOLE</b></h2>
<img src="D:\my project\images and videos\historical places\aihole2.jpg" width="300" height="300"> 
<blockquote>Aihole (pronounced "Eye-ho-lé"), also referred to as Aivalli, Ahivolal or Aryapura, is a historic site of ancient and medieval era Buddhist, Hindu and Jain monuments in north Karnataka (India) dated from the fourth century through the twelfth century CE. Located around an eponymous small village surrounded by farmlands and sandstone hills, Aihole is a major archaeological site featuring over one hundred and twenty stone and cave temples from this period, spread along the Malaprabha river valley, in Bagalakote district. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Aihole is 22 miles (35 km) from Badami and about 6 miles (9.7 km) from Pattadakal, both of which are major centers of historically important Chalukya monuments. Aihole, along with nearby Badami (Vatapi), emerged by the 6th century as the cradle of experimentation with temple architecture, stone artwork, and construction techniques. This resulted in 16 types of free-standing temples and 4 types of rock-cut shrines.  The experimentation in architecture and arts that began in Aihole yielded the group of monuments at Pattadakal, a UNESCO world heritage site.
</blockquote>
<h4>History</h4>
<blockquote>Aihole is referred to as Ayyavole and Aryapura in its inscriptions and Hindu texts from 4th to 12th century CE, as Aivalli and Ahivolal in colonial British era archaeological reports. 
Aihole has been a part of Hindu mythologies. It has a natural axe-shaped rock on the Malaprabha river bank north of the village, and a rock in the river show a footprint.[ Parashurama, the sixth Vishnu avatar, is stated in these legends to have washed his axe here after killing abusive Kshatriyas who were exploiting their military powers, giving the land its red color.  A 19th-century local tradition believed that rock footprints in the river were those of Parashurama.  A place near the Meguti hillocks show evidence of human settlement in prehistoric period. Aihole has historical significance and has been called a cradle of Hindu rock architecture .
</blockquote>
<blockquote>The documented history of Aihole is traceable to the rise of the Early Chalukya dynasty in 6th century. ] It became, along with nearby Pattadakal and Badami, a major cultural center and religious site for innovations in architecture and experimentation of ideas.  The Chalukyas sponsored artisans and built many temples in this region between the 6th and 8th centuries.  Evidence of wooden and brick temples dating to 4th-century have been unearthed. Aihole started the experimentations with other materials such as stone around the 5th century when the Indian subcontinent saw a period of political and cultural stability under the Gupta Empire rulers. Badami refined it in 6th and 7th centuries. The experimentations culminated in Pattadakal in the 7th and 8th centuries becoming a cradle of fusion of ideas from South India and North India.

<h4>Durga temple complex</h4>
<blockquote>The Durga temple is the best known and studied of the Aihole temples. It has a misleading name, because the temple is not named after goddess Durga. According to one theory, it stands near the ruins of a fort-like enclosure or durg during a time of late medieval era Hindu Muslim conflict in the region.  According to another local tradition, a stone rubble durg and lookout was assembled on its flat roof and locals therefore began calling it the Durga temple.  The temple was originally dedicated to Hindu gods Surya and Vishnu. The temple was dated by early scholars to the 5th century CE, but variously revised to be from between the late 6th and early 8th century.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>The Durga temple is the principal attraction for Aihole visitors and iconic in its apsidal layout.  This shape is similar to 2nd or 1st century BCE Buddhist chaitya halls found in Ajanta Caves. The Durga temple stands on a high moulded adisthana and a damaged tower that had a curvilinear shikhara. The damaged tower's amalaka crown lies on the ground.  A colonnaded and covered ambulatory passage with major carvings runs around the sanctum. The mukha mandapa (main hall) and the sabha mandapa (community hall for functions) show intricate carvings.

<blockquote>Chennakesava (lit, "handsome Kesava") is a form of the Hindu god Vishnu. The temple is dedicated to Vishnu and has been an active Hindu temple since its founding. It is reverentially described in medieval Hindu texts, and remains an important pilgrimage site in Vaishnavism  The temple is remarkable for its architecture, sculptures, reliefs, friezes as well its iconography, inscriptions and history. The temple artwork depicts scenes of secular life in the 12th century, dancers and musicians, as well as a pictorial narration of Hindu texts such as the Ramayana, the Mahabharata and the Puranas through numerous friezes.  It is a Vaishnava temple that reverentially includes many themes from Shaivism and Shaktism, as well as images of a Jina from Jainism and the Buddha from Buddhism. The Chennakeshava temple is a testimony to the artistic, cultural and theological perspectives in 12th century South India and the Hoysala Empire rule.
</blockquote>
<h4>History</h4>
<blockquote>The Hoysala period of South Indian history began about 1000 CE and continued through 1346 CE. In this period, they built around 1,500 temples in 958 centres.  Belur is called Beluhur, Velur or Velapura in old inscriptions and medieval era texts. It was the early capital of the Hoysala kings. The city was so esteemed by the Hoysalas that it is referred to as "earthly Vaikuntha" (Vishnu's abode) and "dakshina Varanasi" (southern holy city of Hindus) in later inscriptions. .
</blockquote>
<blockquote>One of the Hoyasala kings was Vishnuvardhana, who came to power in 1110 CE .  He commissioned the Chennakeshava temple dedicated to Vishnu in 1117 CE after an important military victory in 1116 CE.  According to a later mythology, Vishnuvardhana built this temple to mark his conversion to Sri Vaishnavism after coming under the influence of Ramanuja, but states Shadakshari Settar, the historical records do not support this theory. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>The Chennakeshava temple at Belur took 103 years to build.  Vishnuvardhana moved his capital to Dvarasamudra (now called Halebidu), where he started the construction of the Hoysaleswara Temple dedicated to Shiva. Its construction continued till he died in 1140 CE. His legacy was continued by his descendants who completed the Hoysaleswara Temple in 1150 CE, and the Chennakesava Temple, Somanathapura in 1258 CE.  The Hoysalas employed many noted architects and artisans who developed a new architectural tradition, which art critic Adam Hardy called the Karnata Dravida tradition. .
</blockquote>
<blockquote>The Hoysala Empire and its capital was invaded, plundered and destroyed in the early 14th century by Malik Kafur, a commander of the Delhi Sultanate ruler Alauddin Khalji.  Belur and Halebidu became the target of plunder and destruction in 1326 CE by another Delhi Sultanate army.[  The territory was taken over by the Vijayanagara Empire.[12] The Hoysala style, states James C. Harle, came to an end in the mid 14th century, when King Ballala II was killed in a war with the Muslim army led by Malik Kafur.
