<img src="D:\my project\images and videos\waterfalls\Abbey-Falls-10.jpg" width="300" height="300">  <img src="D:\my project\images and videos\waterfalls\abbey3.jpg" width="300" height="300">
</pre>
<blockquote>Abbey Falls, Karnataka, also spelt as Abbi Falls or Abbe Falls, arises at a height of 70 meters from the mountains of the Western Ghats, and is one of the popular falls in the state. The exotic locale where the gurgling waterfall cascades amidst lush green coffee plantation and joins the River Kaveri attracts many tourists. The hills and the coffee plantation replete with coffee bushes interspersed with tall trees over which pepper vines are entwined combine to form remarkable natural aesthetics. To reach Abbey Falls, you must go to Madikeri town from where you have to travel through a narrow road for 8 km. The path to the waterfall goes through coffee and cardamom plantations. You can take your car to the entrance of these falls after which you will have to walk downhill for 500 meters on slightly paved steps to reach the waterfall. You can hear the roar of the waterfall from the road. From a hanging bridge across the gorge you can get a splendid view of the waterfall and capture its beauty on your camera. The best time to visit Abbey Falls is early winter when the waterfall swells up due to the abundance of rain water.
</blockquote>
<h4>History</h4>
<blockquote>The Abbey Falls was known as Jessy Waterfalls during the time of the British. It was named in the memory of Jessy, the daughter of Madikeri’s first chaplain.
</blockquote>
<h4>Attractions</h4>
<blockquote>The view of Abbey Falls gushing abruptly from the midst of the mountains, tumbling over boulders and subsiding to a quiet little pool is an enthralling sight, especially when your eyes view the entire landscape encompassing coffee plantations, spice estates and green trees. Here, several streams originate from the mountain and surge down to join River Kaveri. After the monsoons, these streams swell with water and plunge down the slope at great speed dashing against the huge rocks, spraying frothy water to great distances. The view from the hanging bridge is beautiful.  From here you can see misty clouds floating above the falls. Abbey Falls is a scenic picnic spot. On one side of this bridge is a Kali Mata Temple. While tourists can take a dip in the cool waters, they are cautioned to refrain from doing this especially during the monsoon months when the rocks are slippery. They can enjoy the dip within the fenced area. Also, you have to be alert and watch out for leeches as they are rampant. You can also plan to visit the nearby sites such as Iruppu Falls, Tadiandamol, Tala Cauvery and Bhagamandala.

<pre>

</pre>
<blockquote>The broad and beautiful Unchalli Falls in Karnataka can be found only 35 kilometers from Sirsi. Once you reach Animalli Village on the main road, you will need to take a left.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Unchalli is referred to as Keppe Joga or Jog Falls by the locals on account of the similarity of its height and rocky outcrop to the world famous Jog Falls. The drive from the main road takes you through villages and agricultural plots of arecanut until you come to Heggarne Circle from where the falls are six kilometers.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Being a famous destination, signboards and locals can direct you to it. Public bus will take you only till Heggarne Circle, and further on is Unchalli village. Start this trek from the village of Unchalli, only 2.5 kilometers, at the Forest Gate.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>You can start out on foot from the Forest Gate; however, if you are one of those enthusiastic trekkers you can also begin on foot from Heggarne Circle itself. There is a defined trail all the way to your first and only viewpoint after which the falls are less than a kilometer away.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>This is a downhill trek on steep, jagged brown rock. The views offered on this trail are of striking lush green forest cover amidst which Unchalli silently falls in the distance. It is only when you near it that you realize the rapidity with which her water gurgles.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>The trail to Unchalli Falls is completely off limits in the monsoon, being safe only in the hot, non-monsoon months between January and April. Do not even dream of attempting it otherwise as its slippery rock poses too much of a risk to your safety.
Even in the right months, if you want to go all the way to the falls, you will need a local guide to do so, unless you have experience in climbing, trekking or exploring forested hills of evergreen and semi-evergreen forest. With a local guide, the trek from the viewpoint to the bottom of the falls will be approximately one-two kilometers and you are sure to see a lot more than if you are on your own.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Many small and big caves that make for ideal hiding places for animals can be found here, their droppings and scat indicating the same. Birds rest in the caves and rocks - bee-eaters, egrets, Malabar whistling thrushes and others flitter around Unchalli. The earlier in the morning you manage to set out, the higher are your chances are of catching a quiet moment with these animals and birds. If you're really lucky, you can even experience a mild and almost translucent rainbow sprawled right across Unchalli Falls at dawn.
 
The natural pool in front of the falls is cordoned off such that if you swam there you would probably feel like you were in the grandest natural swimming pool in all of south India!

The island town of Shivanasamudra divides the river into twin waterfalls. This creates the fourth largest island in the rivers course. A group of ancient temples are located here and there likely was a village.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>This is a segmented waterfall. Segmented waterfalls occur where the water flow is broken into two or more channels before dropping over a cliff, resulting in multiple side by side waterfalls. It has an average width of 305 meters, a height of 98 m, and an average volume of 934 cubic meters / sec. The maximum recorded volume is 18,887 cubic meters / sec. It is a perennial waterfall. The time of best flow are the monsoon season of July to October. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>A common misconception about these waterfalls are that the left segment is called Gaganachukki and the right segment is called Bharachukki. In reality the Bharachukki falls   are a few kilometers to the south-west of the Gaganachukki falls  . This is due to the Kaveri river itself splitting a few kilometers to the south into western and eastern branches . The western branch results in the twin waterfalls of Gaganachukki, whereas the eastern branch results in the Bharachukki falls. The Gaganachukki waterfalls are best viewed from the Shivanasamudra watch tower . Most of the pictures showing the twin waterfalls are taken from that location. There is another approach to the Gaganachukki falls from the Darga Hazrath Mardane Gaib (Imam Ali)  . Despite warnings being posted, people climb down the rocks and attempt to view the waterfalls from behind/top, resulting in many fatal accidents. It is 139 km from the city of Bangalore.
</blockquote>
<h4>Power generation</h4>
<blockquote>India's Second hydro-electric power station is located at the waterfall and is still functional. This station was commissioned by the Diwan of Mysore, Sir K. Seshadri Iyer. The power generated here was initially used in Kolar Gold Fields. India's and First hydro-electric power station is located at Darjeeling Sidrapong Hydroelectric Power Station. They were among the first in Asia.
